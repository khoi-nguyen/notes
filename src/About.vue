                Hi! I'm the main developer of this project
                and am in charge of the Python code
                that generates the teaching resources.
            p.
                I'm currently doing my PGCE at the
                #[a(href='https://ox.ac.uk') University of Oxford]
                and will teach next year at the
                #[a(href='https://kingscollegeschools.org/madrid/school/') British School of Madrid].
                As a mathematician, my specialties were harmonic analysis
                and differential geometry.
            p.
                When I'm not teaching or working on this project,
                I enjoy table tennis and playing the piano.
