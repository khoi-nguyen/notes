                Hi! I'm Khoi Nguyen but my pupils call me Mr Nuggets
                because they find it easier to pronounce.
                I'm the main developer of this project
                and am in charge of the Python code
                that generates the teaching resources.
            p.
                I'm currently doing my PGCE at the
                #[a(href='https://ox.ac.uk') University of Oxford].
                From August 2020 onwards, I will be teaching mathematics at the
                #[a(href='https://kingscollegeschools.org/madrid/school/') British School of Madrid].
            p.
                Before teaching, I was a web developer, and before that,
                I was a research student at
                #[a(href='https://imperial.ac.uk') Imperial College],
                where I studied harmonic analysis on Lie groups.

            p.
                When I'm not teaching or working on this project,
                I enjoy table tennis and playing the piano.
                I took part in the
                #[a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d12Dgfd09SI') 2020 Table Tennis Varsity Game]
                as Oxford's fourth player.

            h4 Resource Coordinator
            p.
                Hello to all reading! I am Tom Chambaud, a
                half-French Teacher of Mathematics. In 2019, I graduated
                from #[a(href='https://www.keele.ac.uk') Keele University] with a
                First-Class honours degree in Mathematics and obtained my PGCE qualification from
                the #[a(href='https://ox.ac.uk') University of Oxford] the following year.
            p.
                With a passion for helping young people and enjoying
                life outside of teaching, I wish to invigorate the
                like-minded and students alike. My hobbies include
                competitive badminton, cooking great food and
                playing piano!
