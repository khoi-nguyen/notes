                Hi! I'm the main developer of this project
                and am in charge of the Python code
                that generates the teaching resources.
            p.
                I'm currently doing my PGCE at the
                #[a(href='https://ox.ac.uk') University of Oxford]
                and will teach next year at the
                #[a(href='https://kingscollegeschools.org/madrid/school/') British School of Madrid].
                As a mathematician, my specialties were harmonic analysis
                and differential geometry.
            p.
                When I'm not teaching or working on this project,
                I enjoy table tennis and playing the piano.

                Hello to all reading! I am Tom Chambaud, a
                half-French Teacher of Mathematics. In 2019, I graduated
                from #[a(href='https://www.keele.ac.uk') Keele University] with a
                First-Class honours degree in Mathematics and obtained my PGCE qualification from
                the #[a(href='https://ox.ac.uk') University of Oxford] the following year.
            p.
                With a passion for helping young people and enjoying
                life outside of teaching, I wish to invigorate the
                like-minded and students alike. My hobbies include
                competitive badminton, cooking great food and
                playing piano!
