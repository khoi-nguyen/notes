## Setting up

- Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
- Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Install [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the following extensions
  (`Ctrl+comma` to open the settings, then go to the `+ Install` tab):
    - build (by noseglid)
    - pdf-view-plus (by Aerijo)
    - language-pfm (by leipert)
- Clone this repository in Atom (`Ctrl+Shift+8`, `Clone an existing Github repository`, Clone from `https://github.com/khoi-nguyen/teaching.git`)

For **Windows**, press `F7` and select `nfs_for_windows`,
then press `F7` and select `start_vm`.
For **MacOS/Linux**, you can just press `F7` and select `start_vm`.
This could take a while depending on your internet connection.

Open a `.md` file to edit (e.g. `12/differentiation.md`),
press `F7` and select `current`.
After the build, you can open the generated PDF (e.g. `12/differentiation.handout.pdf`).
Subsequent builds can be triggered by pressing `F9`,
which repeats the last build (`F7`).

## Additional steps if you want to contribute
