# How do you read a linear equation?

::: {.Question t="HELLO"}
How would you read $x + 3 = 5$?
:::

::: Solution
I have a number and when I add three, I get five.
:::

::: Example
How would you read $x + 9 = 3$?
:::

::: Solution
I have a number and when I add nine, I get three. What could I add to nine to get three?
:::

# What about these examples?

::: Example
How would you read $2x = 4$?
:::

::: Solution
I have a number and when I multiply it by two, I get four.
:::

::: Example
How would you read $-4x = 16$?
:::

::: Solution
I have a number and when I multiply it by negative four, I get positive sixteen.
:::

# How do we solve a two-step linear equation?

::: Example
$2x +1 = 5$?
:::

TODO: Find a way to code so that we can see a worked through example.


# Two-step Linear Equations

::: {.Exercise cols=2}
#) solve `equation("2*x +1 = 5")`
#) solve `equation("3*x +2 = 11")`
#) solve `equation("4*x + 9 = 13")`
#) solve `equation("1/2*x + 1 = 5")`

# Graph

::: Exercise
Plot $y = 3x + 1$
